            <h4>Best Medical & Health care Needs to Our Patients</h4> <br><br>
            <p style="word-spacing: 6px;">
                Having been established in 2010, Rayat Bahra Dental College and Hospital is an accredited dental
                college, approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Dental Council of India (letter
                no.V.12017/46/2008-DE) and has constantly strived towards excellence in all aspects. Started with the
                vision of Mr. Gurvinder Singh Bahra and Mr. Nirmal Singh Rayat the college aims at providing quality
                education and relevant experience to students aspiring a bright career in the Dental and Maxillofacial
                field. It is our endeavor to help the students achieve their dreams in every possible manner.
                Well-qualified and experienced faculty, open platforms for discussions and regular assignments and
                assessments are, to name a few, methods by which we encourage our students to excel. To help them
                through this process the college has recently also introduced the concept of mentors; wherein one mentor
                is assigned to five students. This gives the student an opportunity to talk about and discuss any
                pressing issue, be it personal or academic. Individualized care and not ‘factory-line’ teaching is the
                idea behind this step. Scholarships from the Rayat Bahra group are also made available to deserving and
                in-need student</p> <br> <br>
            <p style="word-spacing: 6px;">“Pratyaksh ko pramaan kya”; as they say, what is evident needs no proof. Rayat
                Bahra Dental College and Hospital, proudly boasts of the best in class infrastructure, faculty,
                equipment, manpower and teaching methodologies. Students here are encouraged towards lateral thinking
                and mind application. Learning is encouraged through not just textbooks but also recent references from
                journals, a plethora of which is provided in our library. Apart from providing top of the line
                professional development, we at Rayat Bahra Dental College and Hospital, firmly believe in an overall
                advancement and evolution of an individual. Keeping in mind the philosophy “all work and no play makes
                jack a dull boy” we have play grounds and courts for sports like cricket,football,badminton,volleyball
                and basketball to name a few. Annual co-curricular events like the cultural fest and sports day are also
                organized at the university level.</p>

                            and
                            neck. Otolaryngology is
                            a shortened
                            form of the term otorhinolaryngology, which comes from Greek words for ear (oto), nose
                            (rhino),
                            and

                            (laryn).

                            Otolaryngologists used to focus solely on problems of the ear, nose, and throat. You may

                            an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) or ENT doctors. Over the last 50 years, the specialty has
                            expanded to
                            include all
                            structures of the head and neck except for the eyes and brain.</div>

                        <div class="card-text "> A birth center is a healthcare facility for childbirth that focuses on
                            the midwifery model, according to the American Association of Birth Centers. They aim to
                            create a birth environment that feels more comfortable to the mother and allows for a
                            cost-effective, family-inclusive birth.

                            Birth centers are not typically equipped with the same contingency equipment and staff as a
                            hospital, such as surgeons in case of a C-section or a neonatal intensive care unit. As a
                            result, birth centers accommodate only healthy pregnancies without any known risk or
                            complication factors.

                            These facilities are guided by principles of prevention, sensitivity, safety,
                            cost-effectiveness and appropriate medical intervention when needed.</div>
