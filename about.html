                        <div class="card-text " style="text-align: justify;"> A birth center is a healthcare facility
                            for childbirth that focuses on
                            the midwifery model, according to the American Association of Birth Centers. They aim to
                            create a birth environment that feels more comfortable to the mother and allows for a
                            cost-effective, family-inclusive birth.

                            Birth centers are not typically equipped with the same contingency equipment and staff as a
                            hospital, such as surgeons in case of a C-section or a neonatal intensive care unit. As a
                            result, birth centers accommodate only healthy pregnancies without any known risk or
                            complication factors.

                            These facilities are guided by principles of prevention, sensitivity, safety,
                            cost-effectiveness and appropriate medical intervention when needed.</div>
