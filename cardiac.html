            <h1>Heart Diseases and Conditions</h1>
            <p>There are many diseases and conditions that affect the heart. As a group, heart disease is the
                leading cause of
                death the world over. In the United States, it is the most common cause of death for both men
                and
                women.
                According to the CDC, 1 in every 4 deaths is due to a heart condition. The most frequent type is
                coronary heart
                disease but there are many other types as well.

                We know that the heart has valves, muscular walls, and vessels supplying it with oxygen and
                nutrition called
                coronary arteries. Any one of these structures can be afflicted by disease. The heart also has
                an
                electrical
                system that can become dysfunctional, giving rise to rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias). Some
                heart
                conditions
                are present at birth and are known as congenital defects. By considering which structure they
                are
                affecting, we
                can categorize most of the heart diseases and conditions into the following types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
                <li>arrhythmias</li>
                <li>Valvular heart disease</li>
                <li>Heart muscle disease</li>
                <li>Congenital defects</li>

            <h1>Coronary heart disease</h1>
            <p>Coronary arteries become thicker and narrower by a process known as atherosclerosis. This can
                reduce
                the heart’s blood supply. When oxygen demands are not met, ischemia will occur. Ischemia
                manifests
                as pain in the chest or angina. If an artery gets completely occluded with a clot, cardiac
                muscle
                will die. This is called infarction, commonly known as a heart attack.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>coronary heart disease, or atherosclerotic heart disease. It’s a serious condition that
                    happens
                    when plaque builds up in your coronary arteries, which bring oxygen-rich blood to your
                    heart.
                </li>

                <li> Your arteries are smooth and elastic. But when plaque builds up on their inner walls, it
                    can
                    make them stiff and narrow. This slows blood flow to your heart muscle, so it doesn’t get
                    the
                    oxygen it needs. </li>

                <li> The plaque could also break off, leading to a heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac
                    death.
                    CAD affects millions of Americans.</li>

            <h1>Valvular heart disease</h1>
            <p>Valves maintain unidirectional blood flow in the heart and when something goes wrong with them,
                different problems can arise. In stenosis, a valve is too stiff and narrow. It will not open
                wide
                enough causing obstruction to blood flow. During regurgitation, a valve is leaky and allows
                backflow
                of blood. Another condition is where a loose, weak valve will prolapse into the next chamber.

                Rheumatic fever, an illness that may occur after throat infections, has a propensity to damage
                heart
                valves. Valvular heart disease is the result of rheumatic fever in so many cases, a distinct
                clinical entity rheumatic heart disease (RHD) deals specifically with the issue.</p>
            <p>Heart valve disorders can arise from 2 main types of problems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regurgitation (or leakage of the valve). When the valve(s) do not close completely, it
                    causes
                    blood to flow backward through the valve. This reduces forward blood flow and can lead to
                    volume
                    overload in the heart.</li>
                <li>Stenosis (or narrowing of the valve). When the valve(s) opening becomes narrowed, it limits
                    the
                    flow of blood out of the ventricles or atria. The heart is forced to pump blood with
                    increased
                    force to move blood through the narrowed or stiff (stenotic) valve(s).</li>

                <h1>Heart muscle disease</h1>
                <p>The clinical term used for a disease that affects heart muscle is cardiomyopathy. An enlarged
                    heart with weak walls is dilated cardiomyopathy. When the walls are abnormally thick, it’s
                    hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a cause of sudden death in athletes). These are the two chief forms
                    of heart muscle disease. Cardiomyopathies can be the result of a variety of causes such as
                    ischemia, hypertension, infections, toxins, and certain drugs. They could also be genetic in
                    origin. In cases where no specific cause can be ascertained, the cardiomyopathy is termed
                    idiopathic.</p> <br>
                <h1>cardiomyopathy</h1>
                <p>Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases of the heart muscle. These diseases have many causes, signs and
                    symptoms, and treatments.

                    In cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick, or rigid. In rare cases, the muscle
                    tissue in the heart is replaced with scar tissue.

                    As cardiomyopathy worsens, the heart becomes weaker. It's less able to pump blood through the
                    body and maintain a normal electrical rhythm. This can lead to heart failure or irregular
                    heartbeats called arrhythmias. In turn, heart failure can cause fluid to build up in the lungs,
                    ankles, feet, legs, or abdomen.

                    The weakening of the heart also can cause other complications, such as heart valve problems.</p>
                <p>Cardiomyopathy can be acquired or inherited. "Acquired" means you aren't born with the disease,
                    but you develop it due to another disease, condition, or factor. "Inherited" means your parents
                    passed the gene for the disease on to you. Many times, the cause of cardiomyopathy isn't known.

                    Cardiomyopathy can affect people of all ages. However, people in certain age groups are more
                    likely to have certain types of cardiomyopathy. This article focuses on cardiomyopathy in
                    adults.</p> <br>
                <h1>Symptoms</h1>
                <p>Some people who have cardiomyopathy never have signs or symptoms. Others don't have signs or
                    symptoms in the early stages of the disease.

                    As cardiomyopathy worsens and the heart weakens, signs and symptoms of heart failure usually
                    occur. These signs and symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially with physical exertion</li>
                    <li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li>
                    <li>Swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other signs and symptoms may include dizziness; light-headedness; fainting during physical
                    activity; arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats); chest pain, especially after physical exertion or
                    heavy meals; and heart murmurs. (Heart murmurs are extra or unusual sounds heard during a
                    heartbeat.)</p>
